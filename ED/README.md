# Antigravity Documentation (ED)

Welcome to the **ED** (Engineering Documentation) for Antigravity.
This directory contains "Intense Usage" documentation — detailed, code-level architectural references for the system's core pillars.

## 🏛 Architecture (`ai/ED/architecture/`)
Deep dives into the patterns that define the system's "Self".

- **[Nexus Pattern](architecture/nexus_pattern.md)**: The I/O Regulator and Event Multiplexer.
- **[Maître d'](architecture/maitre_d.md)**: Intent classification and Tool Selection strategies.
- **[Memory System](architecture/memory_system.md)**: SurrealDB schema, robustness, and RAG.
- **[Capabilities](architecture/capabilities.md)**: Modes, Roles, Quality Tiers, and Tempo.
- **[Observability](architecture/observability.md)**: Unified Tracking, Dashboard metrics, and Alerts.
- **[Budgeting](architecture/budgeting.md)**: Cost control and safety mechanisms.
- **[Learning Loop](architecture/learning_loop.md)**: How the system improves tool selection over time.

## ⚙️ Operations (`ai/ED/operations/`)
Guides on how the system lives, breathes, and boots.

- **[Boot & Lifecycle](operations/boot_and_lifecycle.md)**: The 7-step startup sequence and degraded mode.
- **[Configuration](operations/configuration.md)**: The Authority Chain (DB vs Disk) and Sync logic.

## 📡 API Reference (`ai/ED/api/`)
Comprehensive catalog of endpoints and services.

- **[Router API (5455)](api/router_reference.md)**: Public endpoints, Authentication, and Dispatch.
- **[Agent Runner API (5460)](api/agent_runner_reference.md)**: Admin controls, Health metrics, and Ingestion management.
- **[Background Tasks](api/background_tasks.md)**: Catalog of autonomous system tasks.
