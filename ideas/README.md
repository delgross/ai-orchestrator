# Ideas Folder

This folder contains ideas, proposals, and concepts for the Antigravity Orchestrator system.

## Purpose

Use this folder to:
- **Store ideas** for future features, improvements, or changes
- **Reference ideas** when planning work or making decisions
- **Track concepts** that need evaluation or implementation
- **Document proposals** before they become formal tasks

## How to Use

### Adding Ideas
You can ask me to:
- "Add an idea to the ideas folder about [topic]"
- "Save this idea: [description]"
- "Create an idea file for [feature/concept]"

### Reviewing Ideas
You can ask me to:
- "Show me ideas about [topic]"
- "List all ideas"
- "Review the ideas folder"
- "What ideas do we have for [category]?"

### Using Ideas
You can ask me to:
- "Implement the idea in [file]"
- "Use ideas from the ideas folder for [task]"
- "Evaluate idea [name] for feasibility"

### Modifying Ideas
You can ask me to:
- "Update idea [name] with [changes]"
- "Refine the idea in [file]"
- "Mark idea [name] as implemented/obsolete"

## Organization

Ideas are organized by category or topic. Each idea can be:
- A standalone markdown file (`.md`)
- Part of a category file (e.g., `performance_ideas.md`)
- A structured document with sections

## Naming Convention

- Use descriptive names: `feature_name_idea.md`
- Use categories: `category/idea_name.md`
- Use dates if needed: `idea_name_2026-01-04.md`

## Status Tracking

Ideas can include status markers:
- `[PROPOSED]` - New idea, not yet evaluated
- `[EVALUATING]` - Under consideration
- `[APPROVED]` - Ready for implementation
- `[IMPLEMENTED]` - Already done
- `[DEFERRED]` - Postponed for later
- `[REJECTED]` - Not proceeding with this
