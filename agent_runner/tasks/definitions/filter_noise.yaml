prompt: |
  Scan the 'episode' table for recent rows (last 24h).
  Identify rows that contain only:
  - Acknowledgements ("Ok", "Thanks", "Got it")
  - Empty tool outputs
  - Failed tool calls with no useful error message
  - Phatic communication
  
  UPDATE these rows to set `metadata.noise = true`.
  This allows the Context Window system to filter them out in future prompts.
