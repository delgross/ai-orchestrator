  Read the current `task.md` file (via `read_file` tool).
  Scan recent 'episode' rows.
  
  For each episode:
  1. Determine which Task ID or Phase it relates to.
  2. UPDATE the episode row to set `metadata.task_id = "Phase 49"`.
  
  This allows us to generate "Work Logs" automatically by querying `SELECT * FROM episode WHERE metadata.task_id = 'Phase 49'`.
