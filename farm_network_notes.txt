#### Commands to Try:
1. **Check Current Local Network:**
   ```bash
   sudo nmap -sn 192.168.8.0/24
   ```
   This command performs a ping scan across the current local network.
   
2. **Future Command for New Network:**
   ```bash
   sudo nmap -sn 192.168.11.0/24
   ```
   Use this command after the new router is set up to scan the new network range.
